### 584. Find Customer Referee, SQL, Easy

 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+

```

#### My solutions:

1. 

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name FROM Customer 
WHERE	id NOT IN
(
SELECT id FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id = 2)
```

2. 

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT name FROM Customer
WHERE IFNULL(referee_id,0) <> 2
```



##### Note:

- Deals with `NULL` with subquery solution.
