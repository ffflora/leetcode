### 180. Consecutive Numbers, SQL, Medium

Table: `Logs`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

### My solution:

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs L1
JOIN Logs L2 ON(L2.id = L1.id + 1 AND L1.num = L2.num)
JOIN Logs L3 ON(L2.id = L3.id - 1 AND L3.num = L2.num) 

```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs L1, Logs L2, Logs L3
WHERE L2.id = L1.id + 1 AND L2.id = L3.id - 1 AND L3.num = L2.num AND L1.num = L2.num
```



### Notes:

- Consecutive indicates the `id` are consecutive.
