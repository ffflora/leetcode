#### 601. Human Traffic of Stadium, SQL, Hard

Table: `Stadium`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.
```

 

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with **consecutive** `id`'s, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by `visit_date` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Stadium table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Explanation: 
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.
```

#### My Solution:

```sql

SELECT DISTINCT S1.id, S1.visit_date, S1.people FROM Stadium S1, Stadium S2, Stadium S3
WHERE S1.people >= 100 AND S2.people >= 100 AND S3.people >= 100 AND (
    #t1 as first day
    (S1.id = S2.id - 1 AND S1.id = S3.id - 2 AND S2.id = S3.id - 1 ) OR
    #t1 as 2nd day
    (S1.id = S2.id + 1 AND S1.id = S3.id - 1 AND S2.id = S3.id - 2 ) OR
    #t1 as 3nd day
    (S1.id = S2.id + 2 AND S1.id = S3.id + 1 AND S2.id = S3.id - 1 ) 
)
ORDER BY S1.visit_date

```



##### Note:

1. The tricky part for this problem is need to think of the day `t1` into 3 cases:
   - `t1` is as of the first day : ` t1 - t2 - t3`
   - `t1` is as of the second day : `   t2 - t1- t3`
   - `t1` is as of the first day : ` t2 - t3 - t1`

In the begining I only thought of the first case, and only got the results of the first few days of the consecutive days,  rather than all of the consecutive days. 

2. `JOIN` is a way to deal with consecutive things.
