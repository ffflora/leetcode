287. ### Find the Duplicate Number, Medium

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

 

**Follow up:**

- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?



##### My Solution 

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        return (sum(nums) - sum(set(nums)) ) // (len(nums)-len(set(nums)))
```

##### Notes

- Since the repeated number could be repeated more than once, can take the sum of the whole array minus the `set` of the array, over the diff of length.
