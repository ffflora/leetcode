### 196. Delete Duplicate Emails, SQL, Easy

Table: `Person`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

 

Write an SQL query to **delete** all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```

#### My solution:
```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT id FROM
    (
        SELECT MIN(id) id FROM Person
        GROUP BY email
    ) AS tmp
)
```

##### Notes:

- Use `GROUP BY` to deduplicate
- You can't query and delete from the same table at the same time in MYSQL, so there's another layer of subquery.
- The most inner subquery needs to have an alias.
